This directory contains jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use SLISE.
The first notebook focuses on how to use SLISE for robust regression and why robust regression can be advantageous over normal linear regression.
The following notebooks demonstrates how SLISE can be used to explain outcomes from black box models on various datasets.

The notebooks can be viewed directly on GitHub by opening them. But they can also be viewed interactively through binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/edahelsinki/pyslise/HEAD?labpath=examples) (note that the binder instances tend to be quite slow).
